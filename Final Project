My Name is Mohamad Elian and my partner is Eric Lin, we both coded an AI Bot into a Discord Bot, we did this by using Python and we 
Connected it to OpenAI, there are two takes when doing the video, there is a bad take and a good take, the bad take had a lot of examples
of the AI Bot bugging and having a lot of odd replies, i only included the Bad take so it can show a vissual of some complicatitons we 
went through, some other complications we went through earlier on is that, when coding in the OpenAi Key we Put the Key as a dictiary
in a different .env file, and we had the orginal file read the key, but for some reason our code wasn't reading the Key, so we dicided to
just hard code the Key into the orginal file and it work, another issue we faced was that we didnt orginally know that it cost money to 
put an OpenAI API, but that was easily resolved we added funds into the OpenAi Account and we split the funds evenly between us. 

Our original Project was a discord bot that helps us with online shopping, but then we kept wanting to add more features, then we 
dicided that an AI Bot can do all the features we wanted and it could be a good bot that we can use in our presonal discord with our 
friends so we can all use it to help us with things, while we are playing games or just chatting in our VC's, though as you can see 
in the Bad Take Video there are a lot of buggs in the AI, it still works if your very precised as you can see in the Good Take Video.

Our Code:

import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables from .env
load_dotenv()

# Set the OpenAI API key
openai.api_key ='OpenAI Key'

# Print the loaded OpenAI API key for verification
#print("Loaded OpenAI API key:", openai.api_key)

# Intents setup
intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True

# Initialize the bot with Intents
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents)

# Event: Bot is ready
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"We have logged in as {bot.user}")

# Event: Respond to messages
@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == bot.user:
        return

    # Use GPT to generate a response
    prompt = message.content
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )["choices"][0]["text"]

    await message.channel.send(response)

    # Don't forget to process commands
    await bot.process_commands(message)

# Run the bot with your Discord token
bot.run("Discord Token")
